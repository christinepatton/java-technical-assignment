# Notes

Please add here any notes, assumptions and design decisions that might help us understand your thought process.

I don't like how tightly coupled the various Product and Item classes are. I note, for example, that the Item classes aren't even tested directly, only via the Product tests. If I had more time I would take a much deeper look at these classes and likely do a more thorough refactor on them.
